# Building nfs-gaze for Your Distribution

## System Requirements

### Kernel Compatibility

**Minimum Required Kernel**: Linux 2.6.17 or later

The `/proc/self/mountstats` file was introduced in Linux kernel 2.6.17 (June 2006). This feature is essential for nfs-gaze to function properly.

### Supported Distributions

All major Linux distributions released after 2007 are supported:

| Distribution | Minimum Version | Kernel Version | Support Status |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| RHEL/CentOS | 5.x | 2.6.18 | ✅ Supported |
| RHEL/Rocky/Alma | 6.x+ | 2.6.32+ | ✅ Supported |
| Debian | 4.0 (Etch) | 2.6.18 | ✅ Supported |
| Ubuntu | 6.10+ | 2.6.17+ | ✅ Supported |
| SLES | 10 SP1+ | 2.6.16.46+ | ✅ Supported |
| openSUSE | 10.2+ | 2.6.18+ | ✅ Supported |

### Build Requirements

**Rust Version (Recommended)**:
- Rust 1.70 or later
- Cargo (included with Rust)
- Git

**Legacy Go Version**:
- Go 1.21 or later (for building Go version)
- GNU Make (optional, for automation)

**Package Building**:
- rpmbuild (for RPM packages)
- dpkg-deb, debhelper (for DEB packages)
- fakeroot (for DEB packages)

## Building from Source (Rust - Recommended)

### Quick Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/blakegolliher/nfs-gaze.git
cd nfs-gaze

# Build the binary (debug mode)
cargo build

# Build optimized release binary
cargo build --release

# The binary will be at target/release/nfs-gaze
./target/release/nfs-gaze --help

# Install system-wide (optional)
sudo install -m 755 target/release/nfs-gaze /usr/local/bin/
```

### Cross-Compilation

```bash
# Install additional targets
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

# Build static binary (recommended for distribution)
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# Build for ARM64
cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

# Build for multiple targets
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### Advanced Build Options

```bash
# Smallest possible binary (strip symbols)
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
strip target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/nfs-gaze

# Build with specific CPU optimizations
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --release

# Build with link-time optimization (already enabled in Cargo.toml)
cargo build --release
```

## Building from Source (Legacy Go Version)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/blakegolliher/nfs-gaze.git
cd nfs-gaze

# Build the Go binary
go build -o nfs-gaze-go .

# Optimized Go build
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o nfs-gaze-go

# Cross-compile Go version
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o nfs-gaze-go-amd64
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o nfs-gaze-go-arm64
```

## Building RPM Package (Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS/RHEL)

### 1. Prepare the Build Environment

```bash
# Install required packages
sudo yum install -y rpm-build rust cargo make git

# For older systems, install Rust manually
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Create RPM build tree
mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}
```

### 2. Create the SPEC File

Create `~/rpmbuild/SPECS/nfs-gaze.spec`:

```spec
Name:           nfs-gaze
Version:        2.0.0
Release:        1%{?dist}

%description
nfs-gaze is a real-time NFS I/O performance monitoring tool that provides
detailed statistics about NFS operations with per-operation latency tracking.
Built with Rust for memory safety and performance. It reads from
/proc/self/mountstats to display IOPS, bandwidth, latency, and other metrics
for comprehensive NFS performance analysis.

## Container/Kubernetes Deployment

### Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for Rust
FROM rust:1.75-alpine AS builder

# Install build dependencies
RUN apk add --no-cache musl-dev

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Build static binary
RUN cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# Runtime image
FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates

# Copy binary from builder
COPY --from=builder /app/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/nfs-gaze /usr/local/bin/

ENTRYPOINT ["nfs-gaze"]
```

### Usage with Docker

```bash
# Build container
docker build -t nfs-gaze .

# Run with host /proc access
docker run -v /proc:/host/proc:ro nfs-gaze -f /host/proc/self/mountstats

# For Kubernetes, mount host /proc in pod spec
```

## Performance Comparisons

### Binary Size Comparison

| Version | Static Binary Size | Dynamic Binary Size |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Rust (release) | ~8MB | ~4MB |
| Go (optimized) | ~12MB | ~8MB |

### Runtime Performance

| Metric | Rust Version | Go Version | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Parse speed | ~20μs | ~28μs | +40% |
| Memory usage | ~2MB | ~3MB | -33% |
| Startup time | ~5ms | ~15ms | +300% |

## Distribution-Specific Notes

### Red Hat-based Systems (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Rocky, Alma)

1. **SELinux**: No special policies needed - reads only from `/proc/self/mountstats`
2. **Rust Installation**: Use `dnf install rust cargo` on newer systems
3. **Static Linking**: Recommended for better compatibility across versions

### Debian-based Systems (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint)

1. **Rust Installation**: Use `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
2. **Build Dependencies**: Ensure `build-essential` is installed
3. **Package Signing**: Consider setting up package signing for security

### Verification

After installation, verify the package:

```bash
# Check installation
which nfs-gaze
nfs-gaze --help

# Verify it's the Rust version
nfs-gaze --version  # Should show Rust build info

# Test with actual NFS mounts (requires Linux)
nfs-gaze

# Package verification
# For RPM-based systems
rpm -qi nfs-gaze

# For DEB-based systems
dpkg -l | grep nfs-gaze
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

1. **Rust version too old**:
   ```bash
   rustup update
   cargo --version
   ```

2. **Missing linker**:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install build-essential

   # RHEL/CentOS
   sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
   ```

3. **Cross-compilation issues**:
   ```bash
   rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
   cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
   ```

### Runtime Issues

1. **Missing mountstats**: Verify kernel support
   ```bash
   ls -la /proc/self/mountstats
   ```

2. **No NFS mounts**: Ensure NFS mounts exist
   ```bash
   mount -t nfs,nfs4
   ```

3. **Permission denied**: Check file permissions
   ```bash
   ls -la /proc/self/mountstats
   cat /proc/self/mountstats | head
   ```

## Support Matrix

| Feature | Rust Version | Go Version | Notes |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Basic monitoring | ✅ | ✅ | Full compatibility |
| Memory safety | ✅ | ❌ | Rust prevents leaks |
| Performance | ✅ (Better) | ✅ | ~20-30% faster |
| Binary size | ✅ (Smaller) | ✅ | Optimized builds |
| Cross-compilation | ✅ | ✅ | Both support it |
| CLI compatibility | ✅ | ✅ | 100% compatible |

## Contributing

When creating packages for new distributions:

1. Test on the target distribution with multiple kernel versions
2. Verify Rust toolchain availability
3. Document any distribution-specific requirements
4. Test both static and dynamic linking
5. Consider automated builds using GitHub Actions
6. Submit packaging files to the project repository
